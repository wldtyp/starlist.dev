This GitHub Pages site about GitHub is hosted on GitHub and updates itself using GitHub search data collected by GitHub Actions. 

The git repo for this site can be [found here](https://github.com/wldtyp/starlist.dev) (*extra meta fun: stars it so this site eventually list itself!*) This site was built by Andrew. You can find me on twitter [@wldtyp](https://twitter.com/wldtyp)
