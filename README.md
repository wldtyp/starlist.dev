This GitHub Pages site about GitHub is hosted on GitHub and updates itself using GitHub search data collected by GitHub Actions! 

If anything about that tickles your brain you may like Simon Willson's [git scraping](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/), Github's own [Flat Data](https://octo.github.com/projects/flat-data), or [Quines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)). This site was built by Andrew. The [git repo can be found here](https://github.com/wldtyp/starlist.dev). You can find me on twitter [@wldtyp](https://twitter.com/wldtyp)
