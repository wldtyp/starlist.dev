This GitHub Pages site about GitHub is hosted on GitHub using GitHub search data updated by GitHub Actions. If anything about that tickles your brain you may like Simon Willson's [git scraping](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Oct/9/git-scraping/), Github's own [Flat Data](https://octo.github.com/projects/flat-data), or [Quines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)).
